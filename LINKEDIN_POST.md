🚀 **Excited to share my latest project: FileShare!** 🚀

I've been working on FileShare, a modern file-sharing platform that combines security, speed, and simplicity. It's designed to handle enterprise-level requirements while maintaining a consumer-friendly experience.

**🎯 What makes FileShare special?**

✅ Support for files up to 10GB with unlimited uploads  
✅ End-to-end encryption for maximum security  
✅ Real-time download analytics and tracking  
✅ QR code generation for seamless mobile sharing  
✅ Beautiful, responsive UI with dark mode support  
✅ Lightning-fast performance with instant link generation

**🛠️ Technical Stack:**

Built with cutting-edge technologies to ensure optimal performance:
- Next.js 16 (App Router) for blazing-fast navigation
- React 19 & TypeScript 5 for robust, type-safe code
- Tailwind CSS 4 for modern, responsive design
- Radix UI components for accessible user interface
- Insforge SDK for backend services (Auth, Storage, Database)

**💡 Key Learnings:**

This project pushed me to solve interesting challenges around large file handling, secure authentication flows, and real-time updates. Building with the latest versions of Next.js and React helped me understand the power of Server Components and modern React patterns.

**🌟 Features I'm most proud of:**
- Secure authentication with protected routes
- Real-time upload progress tracking
- Instant shareable links and QR codes
- Clean, intuitive dashboard for file management

The entire codebase is available on GitHub, and I welcome feedback from the community!
